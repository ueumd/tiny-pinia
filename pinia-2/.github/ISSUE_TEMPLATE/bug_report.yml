      description: "If possible, provide a boiled down editable reproduction using a service like JSFiddle, Codepen, CodeSandbox, or a GitHub repository based on this template: https://github.com/piniajs/bug-report. A failing unit test is even better! Otherwise provide as much information as possible to reproduce the problem. You can find examples of different environments at https://github.com/piniajs?q=example&type=source and use them as a bug reproduction. If no reproduction is provided and the information is not enough to reproduce the problem, we won't be able to give it a look **and the issue will be converted into a question and moved to discussions**."
